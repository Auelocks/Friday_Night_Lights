Use machine learning to determine key factors for successfully producing wells in the Permian Basin.

## Team Communication Protocols

The project was the result of work from four team members who worked remotely.  The team utilized Google Meet and Slack for communication and any scripts or files are delivered through this GitHub repository.

## Overview

For decades, scientists and engineers have studied the complex geology, reservoir properties and various production strategies to identify factors most associated with successful reservoir production.  This study is designed to evaluate a large dataset of reservoir properties along with historical well production data to build a machine-learning model that can be used to determine optimal well acreage and production strategies for successful long-term production.
 
### Database

The data is sourced from **SOMEPLACE** and includes **SOME_PROPERTIES** from the Permian Basin.  Historical production timelines are sampled and included to build the machine-learning model.
