Use machine learning to determine key factors for successfully producing wells in the Permian Basin. Quantitative comparison of producing horzitonal wells in the Midland Basin.  

## Team Communication Protocols

The project was the result of work from four team members who worked remotely.  The team utilized Google Meet and Slack for communication and any scripts or files are delivered through this GitHub repository.

## Overview

For decades, scientists and engineers have studied the complex geology, reservoir properties and various production strategies to identify factors most associated with successful reservoir production.  This study is designed to evaluate a large dataset of reservoir properties along with historical well production data to build a machine-learning model that can be used to determine optimal well acreage and production strategies for successful long-term production.  Production is determined by gross EUR (estimated ultimate recovery) which is an approximation of the quantity of oil & gas that is potentially recoverable or has already been recovered over the life of a well.  
 
### Database

The data is sourced from IHS Enerdeq which includes:
(1) well data: API number (unique identifier), surface & bottom-hole location (x/y coordinates), lease name, operator, landing zone, etc.
(2) completion data: lateral length (ft), fluid volume (bbls), & proppant weight (lbs). 

In addition, EUR (estimated ultimate recocery) & well spacing data have been calculated to include in the analysis/machine learning model.  

### Machine Learning Model
